# LivetvLinks (beta)
Android app which shows the links of the livetv.sx website. Specially useful if you have a Kodi (https://kodi.tv/about/) mediacenter with Plexus (https://www.tvaddons.ag/kodi-addons/show/program.plexus/) plugin installed, where you need to introduce the sopcast and acestream ids to watch online sports stream channels (champions league, football, basketball, nba...).

There is no interaction available with the links and they cannot be reproduced through the app. It simply shows the links.
